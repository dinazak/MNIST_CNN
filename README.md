# MNIST_CNN

# Dataset description: 
The MNIST dataset is an acronym that stands for the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology dataset. It is a dataset of 60,000 small square 28Ã—28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten single digits between 0 and 9

# Classifier: 
Convolution neural network (CNN): It is a Deep Learning algorithm which can take in an input image, assign importance (learnable weights and biases) to various objects in the image and be able to differentiate one from the other. The pre-processing required in a ConvNet is much lower as compared to other classification algorithms.
